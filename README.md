# RISC-V Mini Processor


This project aims to implement a compact 8-bit RISC-V processor core, suitable for Tiny Tapeout. The processor is based on a simplified version of the RISC-V architecture, utilizing a customized instruction set inspired by the RISC-V Compressed (RVC) instruction set. The design focuses on minimizing area and power, making it ideal for Tiny Tapeoutâ€™s educational IC fabrication platform. The CPU is implemented in Verilog and is designed to support basic computational, control-flow, and load/store operations efficiently.
